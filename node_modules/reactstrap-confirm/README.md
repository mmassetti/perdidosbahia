An easy to use promise based confirm dialog for reactstrap.

The objective of this package is to offer a simple and easy way for developers to show confirm dialogs within their apps without having to worry about states or having to repeat the same components in many places.

Demo: https://algm.github.io/reactstrap-confirm

## Installation

Simply use npm

```bash
npm i --save reactstrap-confirm
```

You can use yarn as well

```bash
yarn add reactstrap-confirm
```

## Dependencies

You must manually install react, react-dom and reactstrap in your project in order for this module to work correctly.

## Usage

Simply, import the module and call it as a function anywhere in your code.

```javascript
import confirm from "reactstrap-confirm";

// ...code

let result = await confirm(); //will display a confirmation dialog with default settings

console.log(result); //if the user confirmed, the result value will be true, false otherwhise
```

You can also pass options to the confirm function:

```javascript
confirm({
    title: (
        <>
            Content can have <strong>JSX</strong>!
        </>
    ),
    message: "This is a custom message",
    confirmText: "Custom confirm message",
    confirmColor: "primary",
    cancelColor: "link text-danger"
});
```

The above example will render a customized dialog.
